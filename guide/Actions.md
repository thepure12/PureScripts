# Performing Actions
Once the game state has been determined using `getState()`, the script needs to perform actions based on that state. Actions are the core of the script, allowing it to interact with the game worldâ€”moving, attacking, banking, collecting items, and more. Generally it's best to stick with performing **one** action per game tick (once per `loop()`).

### Common Actions
- **Interacting with NPCs & Objects**
    - api.npcs.talkTo("Man")
    - api.objects.interactWith("Tree", "Chop down")
- **Handling Inventory & Items**
    - api.inventory.dropAll()
    - api.bank.withdrawItem("Lobster")
- **Movement & Navigation**
    - api.bank.webwalkGrandExchange()
    - api.pathing.walkNorth(4)
- **Combat**
    - api.inventory.eatFood()
    - api.npcs.attack("Goblin")

### Actions in `loop()`
```typescript
function loop() {
    state = getState()
    switch (state) {
        case State.CHOPPING:
            return api.objects.interactWith("Tree", "Chop down")
        case State.DROPPING:
            return api.inventory.dropAll()
        case State.IDLE:
            return
    }
}
```
